## Introduction
This document articulates the credential for the Emissions Report Verification Statement required for reporting GHG Emissions in British Columbia as per the Greenhouse Gas Industrial Reporting and Control Act, GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REPORTING REGULATION. When large emitters of CO2 reporting annual emissions to BC Cliamte Action Secreteriat, an Emissions Report Verification Statement must be provided as part of the reporting requirements.
B.C. Regulation 249/2015: https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/249_2015
Current guidelines for reporting are described here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change/industry/reporting/verify

This governance document has been developed in accordance with the ToIP’s Governance Metamodel Specification created by the Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG) as the template for this framework.

## Purpose

Scope 1 Greenhouse Gas Emissions from various sources have been unreliably accounted for using various sources. Verifiable Credential standards will be developed as an alternative option for reporting GHG Emissions. 

The GHG Emissions credential must be issued by a third-party verification body. The structure for the credential contains all information needed to fulfil this Verification Statement.

These systems and governance will allow a more trustworthy ecosystem. This will be built under this governance framework. The purpose of this governance framework to outline all rules associated with governance, issuance, verification, and revocation of these GHG credentials. The governance document is applicable to all parties who consume Emissions Report data. 

## Scope

The GF covers the following components:

## Key Roles

Third-party Verifier: Accredited auditor for GHG Emissions

## Key Processes

None - see BC Climate Action Secreteriat and https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change/industry/reporting/verify

## Out of Scope

* Any information not associated or included within a Verification Statement as defined in regulation

## Objectives

The objective of this Governance Framework are to define the rules, requirements, processes and artifacts of a Verification Statement to be applied to _____________ so that _____________ can ensure compliance with ESG frameworks. The objective of this governance framework is to create a verification statement verifiable credential.

## Revisions

A key design principle of the ToIP stack model is to “design for change”. In most cases, GFs are “living documents” that need to evolve as their trust community evolves. There, the ToIP governance Architecture Specification has strict requirements for document versioning.
* Revisions to the GF must be approved by _________________
* At least one public review period should be held for all versions of the GF
* Comment period during the review process must be held during ___________
* Late comments shall not be accepted but may be considered in the following year’s version


## Glossary

In the field of Digital Identity, trust and governance, a well-defined glossary is essential. Glossaries ensure that all stakeholders – businesses, legal, technical and operational – share a collective understanding of the terms used within a GF.
A GF includes a glossary that includes terms in the following three general categories
1. TOIP Core Terms that describe the common components of the TOIP model
1. TOIP Governance Terms are specialized terms used to describe TOIP governance concepts
1. GF Specific Terms are terms needed in the context of this GF. This is included in the __________ Credential Terms Page.

## Risk Assessment
_________________ and ______________ will develop strategies to mitigate risk. There are risks associated with establishing and maintaining a healthy trust community: technical risks, business risks, governance risks, regulatory risks, etc.
Trust Assurance and Certification
While a detailed risk assessment is warranted for this GF, for the first draft of the GF, _____________ has identified the following audit criteria to be assessed by an auditor
* Availability Controls for ____________
* Policies and controls for _______________
* Review of background checks for_______________ 

## Governance Requirements

Trust in a GF requires a Governing Authority. This trust is rooted in the foundational governance documents for the governing authority itself. This includes

1. Verifiable credentials based on sound data. 

1. Provisions in relevant BC Regulations

## Business Requirements

Many business requirements will flow directly from the objectives. Policies in this section will outline business rules common to any business or industry organization. Business rules will apply in the specific context of the GF in order to govern specific actions taken by specific actors performing specific roles and processes within the ____________ and _________ Trust Community.

The Business rules for Scope 1 GHC Emissions Credential Report Issuance are:
1. ________________________________________
1. ________________________________________
1. ________________________________________

## Technical Requirements

The other half is technical interoperability. This is the responsibility of the ToIP technology. The Technical policies for _____________ GF are the following:
1.	The DID for _________ must be ________-
2.	The DID for __________ must be __________
3.	The Verifiable Credential format for _______ and ___________ must be
4.	All Verifiable Presentations of _________- and _____________ must use privacy preserving standards
5.	The User interface for obtaining, processing and presenting __________ and _________ credentials
6.	Must be translate into all human languages

4.	Information confidentiality shall __________________
5.	Information privacy shall _________________

## Inclusion, Equity and Accessibility Requirements

This final category of requirements is especially important for digital trust communities – important enough that this category of controlled document is REQUIRED in a ToIP – compliant GF. Scope 1 GHG Emissions Credentials GF policies in this category are
1.	________________________________________
2.	________________________________________
3.	________________________________________

## Legal Agreements

Legal agreements will be drafted in accordance with _______________ policies and procedures. These agreements will outline contractual commitments between the governing authority and the governed parties playing various roles. ________________ requires the following legal agreements

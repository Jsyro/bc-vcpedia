## Terminology and Notation 

ToIP Governance Requirements Glossary

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in RFC 2119.

• Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.

• Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.

• Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## Purpose

The purpose of ****** Rules is to describe the rules/policies/procedures for verifiable credential exchanges involving EnviroChem (legal name?) with the open global community. The purpose of the rules is to enable all actors to understand agreed upon standards, terminology and processes that allow the community to interact with EnviroChem in a trusted manner. This will help determine a governing framework and operating model for a global ecosystem that identifies how credentials can be issued, held, and verified by our natural resources business, #so that any downstream purchaser, certifier, or financer can be assured of the attested good practices of the BC Industry to prove sustainable resourcing. 

## Localization 

1)	The official language of this framework shall be American English.


## Governing Authority 

1)	Envirochem is the Governing Authority responsible for this Governance Framework (GF).
3)	Company Registration Information - [Envirochem](https://www.orgbook.gov.bc.ca/entity/FM0055862)
4)	The contact information for [Envirochem](https://www.envirochem.com/) is
__________________________
__________________________
Recommendations for the governing parties in the governance model are contained in the Governance Requirements. This is a controlled document. 
****Trinh, review metamodel for this section

## Scope 

Envirochem is a participant in an open ecosystem and the focus of this framework is to describe the process Envirochem uses for exchanges on Indy networks.

## Objectives

This section states the high-level outcomes desired by the trust community through its adoption of the GF. It:
1. SHOULD specify tangible, achievable results (e.g. SMART criteria and Fit-for-Purpose criteria).
2. MUST only contain outcomes over which the GF has the authority and mechanisms to achieve within its
scope.
3. MUST be consistent with the principles of the GF (below).


## Principles 

***these are standard principals from ToIP, example to be edited by Envirochem
1)	Sustainability
2)	Stewardship 
3)	Public good
4)	Transparency
5)	Citizen Engagement
6)	Digital Sovereignty
7)	Security
8)	Confidence
9)	Synchronization

## Privacy (Information Trust Requirements) 2.7

•	Privacy and Minimal Disclosure: Neil to describe verbage around the work they do and how they manage privacy
•	Mention company privacy policy - or copy and paste right here.

## Business Requirements
These are the requirements governing the business model(s) and business rules to be followed by the trust
community. Controlled documents in this category:
1. SHOULD clearly explain any exchange(s) of value between trust community members governed by the
GF.
2. SHOULD define the policies and/or rules governing how and when these exchanges of value take place.
3. SHOULD define the requirements for the use of any decision support systems.
4. SHOULD define how all trust community members will be held accountable for their actions in these
exchanges.
5. SHOULD define how the governing authority, administering authority, and the GF are sustainable under
these requirements.

#Establish Business Connection

1. Envirochem will send an invitation to the other business entity via email. 
2. The receiving party must accept invitation in order to establish a secure connection.

#Issuance of TSM Credential 

1. Using the established connection, Envirochem MUST receive a credential request from the business entity. 
2. Continuing from step 1, the business entity will provide the following attributes in the credential request:
-company_name
-facility_name
-facility_address
-country_operation
-products_name
-operation_type
-infrastructure_type
3. Envirochem will receive and review the request
4. Any clarification questions can be asked via the secure messaging function 
5. Once all data is entered and correct, Envirochem will offer the credential to the business entity
6. Business entity can choose to accept or negotiate the credential to request changes

## Technical Requirements

MUST have an Aries compatable business wallet.

These are the requirements governing technical interoperability. Controlled documents in this category:
1. MUST specify how trust community members will interoperate technically using the ToIP technology
stack by reference to any relevant ToIP specifications and recommendations.
2. SHOULD include any additional specifications and/or specification profiles that are specific to the
technical interoperability within this trust community.
3. SHOULD include references one or more glossaries (see Glossary section) as needed.
4. SHOULD reference any test suites or other testing requirements.


## Revisions - move this to correct spot
How and when Envirochem would change governance framework

1.	Any ecosystem member MUST be able to propose a change to, or translation of the governance framework by contacting the **administrative authority**  e.g. by emailing _____________
2.	Any participant in the CAS Ecosystem SHOULD be able to propose a change to the **CAS Rules** by contacting the **administering authority**  e.g. by emailing _____________
3.	The administering authority MUST implement a change process as specified in the Governance Requirements controlled document.
4.	The **CAS Ecosystem Rules** MUST be revised if_______________

15.	Revisions of the **CAS Rules** SHOULD be compliant with the ToIP Metamodel and MAY be reviewed by **members** of the Trust over IP Foundation.

## Extensions

1)	CAS welcomes other Governance Frameworks to leverage the CAS Ecosystem Framework but does not anticipate the need at this time to specify formal extensions from other external Governance Frameworks that will leverage the CAS Ecosystem Governance Framework.
2)	The CAS Ecosystem Framework is extended by the following internal governance framework: CAS Identifier Governance Frameworks and GHG Emissions Credential Governance Frameworks. 
3)	Requirements for extension, activation and deactivation are ____________________ notification should be made to the trust community through _____________ methods.

## Inclusion, Equitability and Accessibility Requirement

CAS must design the CAS Ecosystem to be able to make credentials available to any legal entity issued a GHG Credential in the CAS Ecosystem.

## TSM Protocol Credential Governance Framework (Primary Document)

## Introduction:

Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM) is a globally recognized performance system that helps mining companies evaluate and manage their environmental and social responsibilities. TSM is a framework consisting of 8 protocols made up of a set of indicators designed to measure a company’s performance in key environmental and social areas.

These areas are listed as three pillars: Communities and People, Environmental Stewardship, and Energy Efficiency. The periodic issuance of TSM reports is required for all members of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). This Governance Framework (GF) documents the TSM credentials and its requirements.

This governance document has been developed in accordance with the ToIP’s Governance Metamodel Specification created by the Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG) as the template for this framework.

## Governance Framework Objectives
The objective of this Governance Framework are to define the rules, requirements, processes and artifacts that enable TSM credentials to be applied to a digital wallet that can be verified by the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) to assess mining companies’ performance on a provincial level.

## In Scope 

* TSM governance

* TSM reporting requirements and process 

* TSM objectives

## Out Of Scope

* Indicators not included in the TSM protocol

* Credentials issued by other authorities

* Evaluation of other priorities

Terminology and Notation
Please reference [Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary).

1.	The standard language for this governing framework is American English.

## Governing Authority

[The Mining Association of Canada (MAC)](https://mining.ca/) is the governing authority and responsible for developing, maintaining, and implementing the Governance Framework for TSM.

The governance and decision-making process for the TSM program includes the following groups and committees:

* The **TSM Governance Team** is a subcommittee of the MAC Board of Directors. This group is responsible for providing strategic direction on all matters related to TSM and making recommendations to the Board on proposed changes to the program.

* The **MAC Board of Directors** sets the overall objective and recommends changes. In practice, the MAC Board will only consider a decision if the Community of Interest Advisory Panel (COI Panel) is comfortable with the direction proposed.

* The **Community of Interest Advisory Panel (COI Panel)** is an independent advisory body comprised of individuals from Indigenous groups, mining communities, 
non-governmental organizations, and organized labour, among others. Industry representatives participate in the panel on an exofficio basis.

## Purpose


This GF describes the TSM credential consisting of the following eight protocols used as performance indicators:

* [Biodiversity Conservation Management Protocol]( https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/towards-sustainable-mining-biodiversity-conservation-management/)

* [Climate Change Protocol](https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/climate-change/)

* [Crisis Management Protocol]( https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/crisis-management/)

* [Indigenous and Community Relationships Protocol]( https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/indigenous-and-community-relationships/)

* [Prevention of Child and Forced Labor Protocol]( https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/prevention-of-child-and-forced-labour/)

* [Safety and Health Protocol]( https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/safety-and-health/)

* [Tailings Management Protocol]( https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/protocols-frameworks/)

* [Water Stewardship Protocol]( https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/water-stewardship/)

A detailed description of the protocols can be accessed at: mining.ca. A primer on TSM Protocols is available [here](https://mining.ca/resources/guides-manuals/tsm-101-a-primer/). TSM credential is a combination of pass/fail scores and letter grades ranging from Level C to Level AAA. The TSM reports acts as a reference to mining stakeholders, such as investors and purchasers. 

## Principles

TSM has a set of [Guiding Principles](https://mining.ca/download/36658/), which all participating members must commit to. These [Guiding Principles](https://mining.ca/download/36658/), address the expectation of its members towards adopting social, economic and environmental practices that align with the priorities and values of their communities of interest. 

## Key Roles

*  **MAC**: MAC is the TSM governing authority. Additionally, MAC will train and setup new members to report their TSM scores using an [online portal]( https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/submit-tsm-data/). If a member struggles to achieve acceptable TSM scores, MAC will assist them in adopting the necessary operational change to improve the TSM scores of these members.

*  **MAC Members**: New MAC members have three years to start publicly reporting, allowing time to train employees for full implementation. Once trained MAC members must annually self-assess their performance against all indicators under the TSM protocols using the rating system (see Section: “Key Processes”).

*  **Verification Service Provider (VSP)**: The VSP acts as auditors’ validation self assessed TSM scores. Every three years, a VSP critically reviews a company’s self-assessments to determine if there is adequate evidence to support the performance ratings reported. A list of VSP can be found [here](https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2022/03/2022-March-Verifier-List.pdf).  
##General Requirements
All members of MAC must adhere to the TSM reporting requirements:

* Self-assessed TSM performance indicators must be reported to MAC annually. Amendments to this requirement are offered to high TSM performers and described in the [TSM Primer]( https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/04/TSM-Primer-English.pdf) under the section labelled “Optional Reporting and Verification Process”)

* Every three years, a Verification Service Provider (VSP) critically reviews a company’s self-assessments to determine if there is adequate evidence to support the performance ratings reported. A list of VSP is provided [here]( https://github.com/bcgov/bc-vcpedia/wiki/www.mining.ca/towardssustainable-mining)

* In the year of external verification, a company’s CEO, or equivalent, is required to submit a letter to MAC that confirms the external verification has been conducted in accordance with the Terms of Reference for VSPs.

* Each year, MAC’s independent COI Panel selects a sample of companies to present and discuss their TSM results

* Each member assigns a senior employee as an Initiative Leader. This person is responsible for coordinating and leading the implementation of TSM within the company and typically has a direct reporting relationship with the company’s Board representative.
The General Requirements section is reserved for policies that apply generally to the Governance Framework as a whole and not just in the context of a particular controlled document.

* All articles concerning ESG data must not sold to third parties. All governing parties shall implement responsible use policies that apply to ESG recording.

* Mines must identify themselves using high assurance verifiable credentials when submitting information related to ESG

* All governed parties shall abide by a Code of Conduct
Self-Assessed TSM reports must be submitted to MAC by ___ deadline date________

## Key Processes

# Key Trust Decisions

The trust decisions made under this GF is the qualification and determination the score of TSM performance indicator and the determination of Credential Issuance to ___________________.

# Implementation Process
New members and new facilities have three years to prepare for submitting their fist TSM report. A full description of this implementation process can be found in the “TSM Implementation” section on page 17 of the TSM Primer.

## Verification Process

Every three years TSM self-assessed scores are validated by an [appointed a TSM Verification Service Provide (VSP)](https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2022/03/2022-March-Verifier-List.pdf). More information about the verification process can be found in the [TSM Verification Guide]( https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/12/TSM-Verification-Guide.pdf)

## Revisions

A key design principle of the ToIP stack model is to “design for change”. In most cases, GFs are “living documents” that need to evolve as their trust community evolves. There, the ToIP governance Architecture Specification has strict requirements for document versioning.

* Revisions to the GF must be approved by _________________

* At least one public review period should be held for all versions of the GF

* Comment period during the review process must be held during ___________

* Late comments shall not be accepted but may be considered in the following year’s version

## Extensions

Changes to the TSM systems must be accepted by MAC Board of Directors. The process of developing a framework includes meetings and discussions with member companies. The TSM Governance Team reviews any recommended changes to TSM protocols before they are presented to the MAC Board of Directors. All changes are approved by the Board before implementation.

## Controlled Documents 

### Glossary

In the field of Digital Identity, trust and governance, a well-defined glossary is essential. Glossaries ensure that all stakeholder – businesses, legal, technical and operational – share a collective understanding of the terms used within a GF. 

A GF includes a glossary that includes terms in the following three general categories

1)	TOIP Core Terms that describe the common components of the TOIP model

2)	TOIP Governance Terms are specialized terms used to describe TOIP governance concepts

3)	GF Specific Terms are terms needed in the context of this GF. This is included in the CAS Scope 1 GHC Emissions Credential Terms Page. 

### Risk Assessment 

MAC will develop strategies to mitigate risk. There are risks associated with establishing and maintaining a healthy trust community: technical risks, business risks, governance risks, regulatory risks, etc.

### Trust Assurance and Certification

Many business requirements will flow directly from the objectives. Policies in this section will outline business rules common to any business or industry organization. Business rules will apply in the specific context of the GF in order to govern specific actions taken by specific actors performing specific roles and processes within the ____________ and _________ Trust Community. The Business rules for TSM Protocol Credential Issuance are:

1)___________________________
2)___________________________
3)___________________________

## Technical Requirements

The structure of the ToIP stack graphically illustrates that governance is only half of what is required for inter-operability within and between trust communities. The other half is technical interoperability. This is the responsibility of the ToIP technology. The Technical policies for TSM GF are the following:

## TSM Protocol Credential Governance Framework (Primary Document)

## 1. Primary Document

## 1.1. Introduction

Established in 2004, the Towards Sustainable Mining™ (TSM) is a globally recognized program developed by the Mining Association of Canada (MAC) to aid mining companies in a standardized way to evaluate and manage their environmental and social responsibilities. The TSM program provides a set of eight (8) protocols that focus on three core pillars: Communities and People, Environmental Stewardship and Energy Efficiency.

Each of the eight protocols consist of a set of indicators designed to help mining facilities build, measure and publicly report on the quality of their management systems and performance in key areas of mining activity at the site level. The periodic issuance of TSM reports is required for all members of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). This Governance Framework (GF) documents the TSM credentials and its requirements.

This governance document has been developed in accordance with the ToIP’s Governance Metamodel Specification created by the Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG) as the template for this framework.

### 1.2. Terminology and Notation

Please reference [Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary).

### 1.3. Localization

The standard language for this governing framework (GF) is English.

### 1.4. Governing Authority

[The Mining Association of Canada (MAC)](https://mining.ca/) is the governing authority that leads the development, maintenance, and implementation of the Governance Framework (GF) for TSM. The governance and decision-making process for the TSM program includes the following groups and committees:

* The **TSM Governance Team** is a subcommittee of the MAC Board of Directors. This group is responsible for providing strategic direction on all matters related to TSM and making recommendations to the Board on proposed changes to the program.

* The **MAC Board of Directors** sets the overall objective and recommends changes. In practice, the MAC Board will only consider a decision if the Community of Interest Advisory Panel (COI Panel) is comfortable with the direction proposed.

* The **Community of Interest Advisory Panel (COI Panel)** is an independent advisory body comprised of individuals from Indigenous groups, mining communities, 
non-governmental organizations, and organized labour, among others. Industry representatives participate in the panel on an exofficio basis.

### 1.6. Purpose

The purpose of this Governance Framework (GF) is to define the parameters of a digital TSM credential.

### 1.7. Scope

This Governance Framework applies to the certification statement credential for the TSM certification from the Mining Association of Canada (MAC).

### 1.8. Objectives

This GF describes the TSM credential consisting of the following eight protocols used as performance indicators (detailed descriptions of the protocols can be accessed online through MAC's Website: [TSM Protocols & Frameworks](https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/protocols-frameworks/)):

* [Biodiversity Conservation Management Protocol](https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/towards-sustainable-mining-biodiversity-conservation-management/)

* [Climate Change Protocol](https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/climate-change/)

* [Crisis Management Protocol](https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/crisis-management/)

* [Indigenous and Community Relationships Protocol](https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/indigenous-and-community-relationships/)

* [Prevention of Child and Forced Labor Protocol](https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/prevention-of-child-and-forced-labour/)

* [Safety and Health Protocol](https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/safety-and-health/)

* [Tailings Management Protocol](https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/protocols-frameworks/)

* [Water Stewardship Protocol](https://mining.ca/flippingbooks/water-stewardship/)


The TSM summary credential is a combination of pass/fail scores and letter grades ranging from Level C to Level AAA.

### 1.9. Principles

TSM has a set of [Guiding Principles](https://mining.ca/download/36658/), which all participating members must commit to. These [Guiding Principles](https://mining.ca/download/36658/), address the expectation of its members towards adopting social, economic and environmental practices that align with the priorities and values of their communities of interest. 

#### Key Roles

*  **Governing Authority**: MAC is the TSM governing authority. Additionally, MAC will train and setup new members to report their TSM scores using an [online portal]( https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/submit-tsm-data/). If a member struggles to achieve acceptable TSM scores, MAC will assist them in adopting the necessary operational change to improve the TSM scores of these members.

*  **Credential Holders**: MAC members are the credential holders. New MAC members have three years to start publicly reporting, allowing time to train employees for full implementation. Once trained, MAC members must annually self-assess their performance against all indicators under the TSM protocols using the rating system (see Section: “Key Processes”).

*  **Verification Service Provider (VSP)**: Independent third-party verifiers act as auditors that validate self-assessed TSM scores. Every three years, a trusted VSP critically reviews a company’s self-assessments to determine if there is adequate evidence to support the performance ratings reported. A list of trusted VSP can be found [here](https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2022/03/2022-March-Verifier-List.pdf).  


#### Key Processes
All members of MAC must adhere to the TSM reporting requirements:

* Self-assessed TSM performance indicators must be reported to MAC annually. Amendments to this requirement are offered to high TSM performers and described in the [TSM Primer]( https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/04/TSM-Primer-English.pdf) under the section labelled “Optional Reporting and Verification Process”

* Every three years, a Verification Service Provider (VSP) critically reviews a company’s self-assessments to determine if there is adequate evidence to support the performance ratings reported. A list of VSP is provided [here]( https://github.com/bcgov/bc-vcpedia/wiki/www.mining.ca/towardssustainable-mining)

* In the year of external verification, a company’s CEO, or equivalent, is required to submit a letter to MAC that confirms the external verification has been conducted in accordance with the Terms of Reference for VSPs.

* Each year, MAC’s independent COI Panel selects a sample of companies to present and discuss their TSM results

* Each member assigns a senior employee as an Initiative Leader. This person is responsible for coordinating and leading the implementation of TSM within the company and typically has a direct reporting relationship with the company’s Board representative.
The General Requirements section is reserved for policies that apply generally to the Governance Framework as a whole and not just in the context of a particular controlled document.

* All articles concerning ESG data must not sold to third parties. All governing parties shall implement responsible use policies that apply to ESG recording.

* Mines must identify themselves using high assurance verifiable credentials when submitting information related to ESG


### 1.10. General Requirements

#### Verification Process

Every three years TSM self-assessed scores are validated by an [appointed TSM Verification Service Provider (VSP)](https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2022/03/2022-March-Verifier-List.pdf). 
More information about the verification process can be found in the [TSM Verification Guide]( https://mining.ca/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2021/12/TSM-Verification-Guide.pdf)

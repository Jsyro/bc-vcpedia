# BC Mines Act Permit - DRAFT
# 1. Primary Document

## 1.1 Introduction

[The Mines Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96293_01) regulates all mining activities in British Columbia – from early exploration to development, production, reclamation, closure, and post-closure. A permit must be in place before any work in, on, or about a mine can occur.

Further information can be found online: [BC Mine Permitting](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/mineral-exploration-mining/permitting)

The development of this documentation follows the governance framework created by the [Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/) [Governance Metamodel Specification](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/ToIP-Governance-Metamodel-Specification-V1.0-2022-12-21.pdf) created by the [Governance Stack Working Group (GSWG)](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group).

## 1.2. Terminology and Notation

Please reference [Glossary - General Trust Over IP Terms](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary).

**Requirements** include any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements. Unless otherwise stated, all Requirements MUST be expressed as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

- Mandates are Requirements that use a MUST, MUST NOT, SHALL, SHALL NOT or REQUIRED keyword.
- Recommendations are Requirements that use a SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, or RECOMMENDED keyword.
- Options are Requirements that use a MAY or OPTIONAL keyword.

**Machine-Testable Requirements** are those with which compliance can be verified using an automated test suite and appropriate scripting or testing software.

**Rules** are Machine-Testable Requirements that are written in a Machine-Readable language and can be processed by a Rules Engine. They are expressed in a structured rules language as specified by the Governance Framework.

**Human-Auditable Requirements** are those with which compliance can only be verified by an audit of people, processes, and procedures.

**Policies** are Human-Auditable Requirements written using standard conformance terminology. The Policies used in the Governance Framework will use the standard terminology detailed in RFC 2119 keywords. Note that all RFC 2119 keywords have weight from an auditing perspective. An implementer MUST explain why a SHOULD or RECOMMENDED requirement was not implemented and SHOULD explain why a MAY requirement was implemented.

**Specifications** are documents containing any combination of Machine-Testable Requirements and Human-Auditable Requirements needed to produce technical interoperability.

## 1.6 Purpose 

The purpose of this Governance Framework (GF) is to define the parameters of a BC Mines Act Permit credential. 

## 1.7 Scope

This Governance Framework (GF) applies to the BC Mines Act Permit credential from [The Mines Digital Services](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/monitoring-mining-operations-in-bc/https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/monitoring-mining-operations-in-bc/). The initial scope of this pilot will focus on developing a credential for a BC Mines Act Permit issued by the entity responsible for the permitting process. The scope of the information included in this credential will be summary level.

## 1.8 Objectives 

This GF describes the BC Mines Act Permit credential consisting of all data elements included in a BC Mines Act Permit. 

## 1.9 Principles 

[The BC Public Service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/about-the-bc-public-service/ethics-standards-of-conduct/corporate-values) has one overarching corporate value, __Integrity__, and 6 core corporate values: Curiosity, Service, Passion, Teamwork, Accountability, and Courage. __Integrity__ is placed above all the other values as a quality that affirms the [Standards of Conduct for the BC Public Service](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/about-the-bc-public-service/ethics-standards-of-conduct/standards-of-conduct).

## 1.10 General Requirements

The BC Mines Act Permit Credential MUST be issued by the ministry responsible for mining activities through the authority of the Chief Permitting Officer (CPO) under section 10 of the Mines Act. CPO means the individual, or a delegate, appointed under the Mines Act primarily responsible for administering and making decisions under the Mines Act in regards to permitting. Under section 8.3 of the Mines Act, the CPO may delegate in writing to an inspector any of the powers conferred on the CPO under the Mines Act. 

## 1.11. Revisions

Version 1.0. 

## 1.12. Extensions

There are no extensions to this Governance Framework.  

## 1.13. Schedule of Controlled Documents

[BC Mines Act Definitions](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96293_01#section1)

*  **Credential Holders**: Mining Operators within BC
*  **Mines Act Permit Holder**: A person and/or a company in whose name a Mines Act Permit Document is recorded in the division records
*  **Major Mines**: Moderate to large-scale mineral and coal mining operations, including sand and gravel pits, quarries, and placer mines.

**Mines Classes**

Summary of Mines Classes as outlined in the [2022 Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in
British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/mineral-exploration-mining/documents/health-and-safety/code-review/health_safety_and_reclamation_code_nov2022.pdf)

**Simple/Regional Mines** have applications for mining activities (Notice of Work) submitted under 10.1.1. Generally this includes mine in production by mine type placer, sand & gravel/aggregate pits, quarries for construction aggregate, and industrial mineral quarries. Also within regional mines are application for exploration projects which occurring prior to production, which includes mining activities for exploration for mineral and coal, under 9.2.1/9.1.1.

**Complex/Major Mines** have application for mining activities under 10.1.2 for surface or underground development or production for coal and mineral mines, or major modifications /expansions of existing producing coal and mineral mines, or underground exploration requiring excavation, large pilot projects, bulk samples, trial cargos and test shipments. 


**Definitions**

* 	**Major** Proposed major mines (e.g., metal and coal mines as well as some large aggregate and industrial minerals operations), major expansions/upgrades to existing mines, and some large-scale exploration/development projects require approval under the Mines Act as per part 10 of the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia (the Code).

* 	**Coordinated Authorizations** are referred by the Chief Permitting Officer (CPO) to manage projects that require multiple permits – for example, a Mines Act permit to construct and operate an outfall and an EMA permit to discharge from it. There are three different routes for a project to come into the coordinated 
authorizations process:
      1. Any new mineral or coal mine project, whether or not reviewable under the Environmental 
Assessment Act (EAA);
      2. A mine project that is an extension, expansion, or re-start requiring multiple 
authorizations;
      3. Any project that the CPO determines would benefit from the coordinated authorizations 
process due to its complexity.

* 	**Major Mines Office (MMO)** All construction and operations permit applications for coal and mineral mines are managed by the Major Mines Office (MMO) and must be submitted through the MMO’s intake email permrecl@gov.bc.ca.
